I am currently a PhD student at Virginia Tech. My research interest lie in understanding how agents learn to interact, coordinate, and communicate in possibly heterogeneous, decentralized, multi-agent systems. My current work specifically aims at characterizing the pricinples behind the emergence of communication in decentrazlied systems, which suffer from non-proximal properties of indivudual learning signal, making for theoretical and practical obstacles in self-incentivized emergent communication dynamics.
